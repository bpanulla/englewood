Englewood
=========

Englewood is a python library for generating maps from maps.

Currently only dot-density maps can be generated, but hopefully other types of maps (contigous and non-contigous cartograms, scaled centroids markers, etc) will follow.

Installation
------------

It's easy!

::
    pip install englewood

Usage
-----

See demo.py for an example of how to generate a dot density map.
